# Build a react app
Make sure _create react app_ is installed on your machine. If it isn't, install it with:

`npm install -g create-react-app`

then simply type

`npm create react app contacts` (or `yarn create react app contacts` when using yarn)

to create a react app named _contacts_

Then simply `cd contacts` to go into the new directory.

And `npm start`(or `yarn start` to start it)
